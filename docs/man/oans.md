# NAME

`oans` — find duplicate data in files and share it with the kernel's
deduplication ioctl.

# SYNOPSIS

| **oans** \[*options*] *file*...
| **oans** **-d** \[**-r**] **\--hashfile**=*FILE* *file*...
| **oans** **\--hashfile**=*FILE*
| **oans** {**\--stats** | **\--history** | **\--json** | **-L**} **\--hashfile**=*FILE*
| **oans** **-R** **\--hashfile**=*FILE* *file*...

# DESCRIPTION

`oans` finds regions of identical data across a set of files and, on request,
asks the kernel to make them share storage — reclaiming the duplicated space
without changing what any file contains. It works on **btrfs** and **xfs**, the
Linux filesystems that support reflink/dedupe.

Deduplication is performed with the kernel's **`FIDEDUPERANGE`** ioctl, which
**byte-for-byte compares** every candidate range and locks the files while it
does so. Because the kernel — not `oans` — moves the data, a bug in `oans` can
only waste work or miss a dedupe; it can never corrupt your files.

Given a list of files and directories, `oans` reads them, hashes their contents
on an extent basis, and groups extents whose hashes match. Without **-d** it
only *reports* what it would dedupe (a dry run); with **-d** it submits the
matches to the kernel and prints how much space was reclaimed.

`oans` scales to large trees by keeping its hashes in a **hashfile** (see
**\--hashfile**), an SQLite database it updates incrementally: on a re-run it
re-hashes only the files whose size or mtime changed, and skips extents that are
already shared. The hashfile is **self-describing** — it records the options,
paths, and excludes of each run — so a scheduled job need only name it (see
**\--hashfile** and the *EXAMPLES*).

`oans` is a fork of `duperemove`; `make install` also installs a `duperemove`
symlink so existing scripts keep working. Its hashfiles are branded and are not
interchangeable with upstream duperemove's (each rebuilds its own; they are only
caches, so nothing is lost).

# MODES OF OPERATION

**Read-only (default).**
Without **-d**, `oans` reads, hashes, and prints the duplicate extents it found
— useful for previewing what a dedupe run would do. Nothing on disk is changed.
It does not concern itself with how an extent is stored (compressed, already
shared, mid-I/O); in dedupe mode the kernel handles those details.

**Deduplicating (-d).**
The same read-hash-compare step, but matching extents are submitted to the
kernel for sharing. Extents that are already shared are detected up front and
skipped, so repeated runs over a mostly-stable tree are cheap. A summary of the
space reclaimed is printed at the end (see *OUTPUT*).

**Report and maintenance modes.**
**\--stats**, **\--history**, **\--json**, **-L**, **-R** and
**\--prune-block-hashes** each inspect or maintain a hashfile and then exit
without scanning for dupes. All but **-R** and **\--prune-block-hashes**
open the hashfile **read-only**; see *NOTES* for running them alongside an
active `oans`.

# OPTIONS

The non-option arguments are the *files* and *directories* to scan, or a single
hyphen (**-**) to read the list from standard input, one path per line. Naming a
directory scans the regular files directly inside it; add **-r** to recurse.

**Symlinks.** A path given as an argument is resolved, so naming a symlink to a
directory scans what it points at, and the files are recorded under their
canonical paths. Symlinks *encountered during* the walk are not followed: only
regular files and directories are descended into. This keeps a run's scope equal
to what was named on the command line — one symlink pointing outside the tree
would otherwise silently enlarge a job that deduplicates data. To include such a
target, name it as an additional argument; scanning a directory and a symlink to
it in the same run is safe, as both resolve to the same canonical path and the
file is recorded once.

## Operation

**-d**
  ~ Deduplicate: submit matching extents to the kernel (**btrfs**/**xfs** only).
    Without **-d**, `oans` performs a read-only dry run and only reports.

**-r**
  ~ Recurse into subdirectories of any directory argument.

<!-- Keep the blank line between this term and its `~` body below: without it
     pandoc >=3.9 collapses this multi-paragraph definition into a single block. -->
**\--hashfile**=*FILE*

  ~ Store hashes in *FILE* (an SQLite database) instead of memory. This is the
    recommended way to run `oans` on anything larger than a handful of files: it
    keeps the memory footprint modest and makes runs **incremental** and
    **resumable**.

    If *FILE* does not exist it is created. A hashfile from `duperemove` or an
    older `oans` is rebuilt; any other existing database is refused and left
    untouched (exit status 1), since a mistyped path can name another
    program's data. If it exists, `oans` compares the
    stored size/mtime of each recorded path and re-hashes only what changed.
    Paths that no longer exist on disk are pruned automatically (by existence,
    so files merely outside the paths scanned this run are kept); the database
    is compacted once enough of it is free.

    New files are added to the hashfile only when they are reachable from the
    *file* arguments, so normally you pass the same paths and **-r** each run.
    Discovery is efficient and visits each file once, even ones already stored.

    Because the hashfile also records the run's options, paths, and **\--exclude**
    patterns, you need not repeat them: **`oans --hashfile=FILE`** with no *file*
    arguments **replays the last run**. The stored settings - **-r**, **-d**,
    the size limits, **\--skip-zeroes**, **\--skip-readonly-subvols**,
    **\--dedupe-options** and the excludes - win over the command line. Options
    that shape only this run (**\--io-threads**, **\--cpu-threads**, **-B**,
    **-q**, **-v**) still apply, and an extra **\--exclude** applies to this run
    without being stored; the block size is always the hashfile's. That includes
    **-d**: a hashfile seeded by a read-only preview
    run replays as read-only forever, so `oans` warns on such a replay and
    prints the command to update it. If none of the stored paths still exist `oans` refuses rather
    than prune every entry — guarding against, e.g., an unmounted drive — while
    individually missing paths are skipped with a warning.

    When deduping from a hashfile, files that have not changed since they were
    last deduped are skipped.

## Scan tuning

**-b** *SIZE*
  ~ Block size used when reading and hashing file data. Default **128K**;
    accepted range **4K**–**1M** (suffixes `K`/`M` accepted). Smaller blocks can
    surface more sub-extent matches when partial matching is enabled
    (**\--dedupe-options=partial**) but cost more CPU and a larger hashfile;
    larger blocks fragment less. Most users never need to change this.

**-B** *N*, **\--batchsize**=*N*
  ~ Group newly scanned files into *generations* of *N* files. Default
    **1024**; *N* is from 1 to 2^31. The dedupe phase always runs once the scan
    is over, and works through the generations in passes of about 65,536 files,
    so up to that number **-B** changes neither the passes nor the memory they
    use. Above it, each pass is one generation of *N* files, which takes more
    memory.

**-m** *SIZE*, **\--min-filesize**=*SIZE*
  ~ Skip regular files smaller than *SIZE* bytes (suffixes `K`/`M`/`G`
    accepted). Trees full of tiny files scan much faster this way, since such
    files rarely dedupe usefully. Default **1**, which skips only empty files.

<!-- Keep the blank line between this term and its `~` body below: without it
     pandoc >=3.9 collapses this multi-paragraph definition into a single block. -->
**\--max-filesize**=*SIZE*

  ~ Skip regular files larger than *SIZE* bytes (suffixes `K`/`M`/`G`
    accepted). By default there is no upper bound. Use it to leave VM images or
    backup archives to other tooling, or to bound the worst-case time spent on
    a single file. A file of exactly *SIZE* bytes is still scanned. It is an
    error to give a *SIZE* below **\--min-filesize**, since nothing could then
    be scanned.

    <!-- -->

    Like **\--min-filesize**, this shapes only what is *scanned*. A file hashed
    by an earlier run and excluded by a later **\--max-filesize** keeps its rows
    until it is deleted from disk — pruning is by existence, not by whether a
    run covered the file — so it is simply not re-scanned, and never re-deduped.

**\--skip-zeroes**
  ~ Detect and skip all-zero blocks while reading. Speeds up scanning of sparse
    or zero-filled data, at the cost of not deduplicating runs of zeroes.

**\--exclude**=*PATTERN*
  ~ Exclude matching files and directories from the scan — handy for skipping
    snapshot mounts, caches and download staging areas. May be given multiple
    times. Because the shell also expands globs, **quote the pattern**.

    <!-- -->

    *PATTERN* uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` (and `ripgrep`, `fd`):

    - A pattern with **no `/`** matches the **file or directory name at any
      depth**: `--exclude '@eaDir'` skips every `@eaDir` in the tree, and
      `--exclude '*.iso'` every `.iso` file.
    - A pattern **starting with `/`** is an absolute path, anchored at the
      filesystem root: `--exclude '/srv/media/cache*'`.
    - A pattern with a **`/` elsewhere** matches at any depth, so
      `--exclude 'Steam/temp'` skips `/data/Steam/temp` and
      `/home/u/Steam/temp` alike. Write a leading `/` to anchor it instead.
    - A **trailing `/`** restricts the pattern to directories, so
      `--exclude 'cache/'` skips directories named `cache` but keeps files of
      that name.
    - `*` matches any run of characters **except `/`**, `?` matches one
      non-`/` character, `[a-z]`, `[!a-z]` and POSIX classes such as
      `[[:digit:]]` match one non-`/` character, and `**` crosses directory
      boundaries. A name that is not valid UTF-8 (an old Latin-1 name, say) is
      matched byte by byte, so there `?` matches one byte. A `\` makes the
      next character literal, inside a class too: `[a\-z]` matches `a`, `-`
      or `z`.

    <!-- -->

    Excluding a directory prunes the walk there, so naming a directory also
    skips everything inside it — there is no need to add a wildcard for its
    contents. Negation (`!`) is not supported.

    <!-- -->

    A pattern that matches nothing during the scan is reported as a warning; a
    malformed one (an unterminated `[`) is an error and `oans` refuses to run.

    <!-- -->

    **Changed in 1.6.0.** Patterns used to be matched with `fnmatch()` against
    the whole path, and a pattern without a leading `/` was resolved against
    the current directory. `--exclude node_modules` therefore matched at most
    one literal directory, and usually nothing at all, silently. If you have
    stored patterns in a hashfile from an earlier release, check them with a
    scan before relying on the next scheduled run.

**\--dedupe-options**=*opt*\[,*opt*...]
  ~ Comma-separated switches that alter *what* gets deduplicated. Prefix an
    option with **no** to turn it off.

    **[no]same**
      ~ Allow deduplicating extents that live within the *same* file. Default
        **on**.

    **[no]partial**
      ~ Also compare *portions* of extents (block-level matching), finding
        dedupe that pure extent matching misses. Powerful but CPU-intensive and
        larger on disk. Default
        **off**. (This path is under active development and its semantics may
        change.)

    **[no]only_whole_files**
      ~ Restrict dedupe to entire, byte-identical files, disabling both extent-
        and block-level matching. The hashfile is smaller and some steps are
        faster, but less duplication is found. Default **off**.

## Threads

**\--io-threads**=*N*
  ~ Number of threads for the I/O-bound stages (directory walk, file hashing,
    dedupe). By default `oans` inspects the scan target's backing storage and
    chooses automatically: the host CPU count capped at **8** for
    non-rotational disks (SSD/NVMe) or unknown media; fewer for a single
    spinning disk (seek-bound); and roughly two per device for a multi-device
    btrfs pool, still capped at 8. Run with **-v** to see the detected storage
    and the value chosen. Passing *N* explicitly disables all of this and uses
    *N* verbatim.

**\--cpu-threads**=*N*
  ~ Number of threads for the CPU-bound duplicate-extent-finding stage. Default
    is the host CPU count capped at **8**; an explicit *N* overrides the cap.

## Reporting and maintenance (each exits after running)

**\--stats**
  ~ Print a summary of the hashfile and exit: its format and identity, the
    stored scan configuration a bare replay would use, how many files and hashes
    it holds, the total logical data tracked, and the whole-file duplication it
    records (duplicate groups and their logical duplicate volume). That volume is
    a logical figure — it is already shared on disk if you have run a dedupe, so
    check **\--history** for bytes actually freed and `compsize`(8) for on-disk
    usage. Requires **\--hashfile**.

**\--history**
  ~ Print the run history recorded in the hashfile and exit: the number of runs,
    the total space reclaimed over their lifetime, and a timeline of recent runs
    (date, reclaimed bytes, elapsed time, files hashed, and whether each was a
    dedupe or a scan). One row is appended automatically per run. Requires
    **\--hashfile**.

**\--json**

  ~ Print the hashfile's current metrics as a flat JSON object — files, hashes,
    logical bytes, duplicate groups, reclaimable bytes, plus lifetime
    run-history totals — then exit. Intended for scripting and dashboards (pipe
    to `jq`, Telegraf, a node_exporter textfile). `reclaimable_logical_bytes` is
    a logical upper bound; real disk freed is smaller on a compressed
    filesystem. Requires **\--hashfile**.

    `scan_configured_dedupe` is `false` when the stored scan configuration has
    no **-d** — a job in that state hashes but never deduplicates, and reports
    `0 B` reclaimed forever, which is also what a healthy job on a clean tree
    reports. This is what tells them apart.

    `scan_skipped_last_run` reports what the most recent scan could **not**
    read, bucketed by cause (`permission`, `unreadable`, `path_too_long`,
    `unsupported_fs`), and `scan_skipped_errors_total` is the lifetime sum.
    Alarm on the former: a lifetime total only grows, so it cannot tell last
    night's lost subtree from one lost months ago. Skips the user asked for
    (**\--exclude**, **\--min-filesize**) are deliberately *not* counted here.

**-L**
  ~ List every file tracked in the hashfile and exit; **-v** adds per-file
    detail. Requires **\--hashfile**.

**\--prune-block-hashes**

  ~ Delete every stored **block** hash from the hashfile, compact it, and exit.
    Requires **\--hashfile**.

    Block hashes exist only to serve **\--dedupe-options=partial**, which is
    off by default — an ordinary scan stores none, whatever **-b** is set to.
    But once written they are removed only when a file is *re-hashed*, and the
    point of a hashfile is that unchanged files are not re-hashed. A hashfile
    that ran **partial** once therefore keeps them indefinitely on a stable
    tree, where they are typically the bulk of the file: a fully-mapped 1 TiB
    at **-b 4K** stores roughly 8 GiB of block digests.

    **\--stats** flags them when the stored scan configuration no longer uses
    partial matching. Pruning is explicit rather than automatic because a later
    **\--dedupe-options=partial** run must re-hash the tree to rebuild them.

<!-- -->

**-R** *file*...
  ~ Remove the named paths from the hashfile and exit; a single **-** reads the
    list from standard input. Requires **\--hashfile**. A relative path is
    resolved against the current directory first. A path the hashfile does not
    hold is reported, and the exit status is then 1. (Deleted files are also
    pruned automatically on the next scan; **-R** is for removing paths that
    still exist.)

## Output and information

**\--skip-readonly-subvols**, **\--no-skip-readonly-subvols**

  ~ Keep read-only btrfs subvolumes — snapshots taken with `btrfs subvolume
    snapshot -r`, i.e. what snapper, Timeshift and Synology create — out of the
    scan. **Off by default**: snapshots are scanned and deduplicated like any
    other directory.

    Turn it on where your snapshots are near-copies of the live subvolume, which
    is the shape a snapper/Timeshift desktop has. A fresh snapshot already shares
    every extent with the subvolume it came from, so reading and hashing it
    reclaims nothing.

    <!-- -->

    That cost is much smaller than it used to be. Within a run, `oans`
    recognises a file whose extents are exactly those of a file it has already
    hashed — the normal case for a snapshot — and takes over that file's hashes
    instead of reading it a second time. The summary reports those as *Same
    layout*, with the volume not read. So a snapshot tree is now mostly free to
    scan, and this option is worth reaching for only when even that is too much.

    Leave it off for a backup target — an rsync-into-a-subvolume-then-snapshot
    setup, say — where each snapshot holds independently written copies of
    unchanged files. Deduplicating those against each other is the whole reason
    to run an offline deduplicator over such a tree, and it is what the option
    would prevent.

    Note the trade the default makes: a writable file deduplicated against a
    snapshot is rewritten to point at the snapshot's extents, so deleting that
    snapshot afterwards frees less than its size suggests.

    Detection is by property (the subvolume's read-only flag), not by directory
    name, so it never fires on a writable directory that merely happens to be
    called `.snapshots`. The number skipped is reported in the run summary and
    in **\--json**; the choice is stored in the hashfile and replayed.

    A whole-file group with a member in a read-only subvolume prefers it as the
    dedupe **target**, so the writable copies are rewritten to point at it rather
    than the other way round.

    This is a preference, not a restriction. The kernel deduplicates *into* a
    read-only subvolume quite happily — the content is byte-verified and never
    changes, only which extents back it — and deduplicating snapshots against
    each other is a normal way to shrink a backup target.

    If you do see `EROFS` (error 30) from the dedupe ioctl, the cause is a
    read-only **mount**, not the subvolume flag: the kernel's
    `vfs_dedupe_file_range_one()` tests the mount. `findmnt -T` *path* will show
    it. A read-only subvolume reached through an ordinary read-write mount is
    unaffected.

<!-- -->

**-q**, **\--quiet**

  ~ Quiet: print only errors and a one-line dedupe summary. Suppresses the live
    progress display, the multi-line summary block, and the per-pass "Simple
    read and compare" report headers.

    The one line is the same **Reclaimed** figure the full summary reports --
    the honest bytes freed -- followed by a **Not deduped:** line if any group
    could not be deduplicated. This is the recommended mode for a scheduled
    job: see *systemd/oans@.service*.

    When output is piped or redirected, the machine-readable
    "net change in shared extents" line is still printed as well. That figure
    is a **fiemap** diagnostic which counts the surviving copy too, so it runs
    roughly twice **Reclaimed** for a pair of duplicates; prefer
    **Reclaimed**, or **\--json**, for reporting.

**-v**
  ~ Verbose: restore the per-group dedupe listing that is hidden by default in
    favor of the progress bar, and show the detected storage / chosen thread
    count.

**\--progress=json**

  ~ Stream machine-readable progress instead of the interactive display, for
    monitoring scheduled or non-interactive runs. One newline-delimited JSON
    object is written to **standard error** per phase (and about once a second),
    ending with a `{"event":"done", ...}` line; standard output is unchanged (so
    the `net change in shared extents` line and the human summary still appear
    there). Works whether or not standard output is a terminal.

    Each line is a self-contained object. During scanning:
    `{"phase":"scanning","elapsed_sec":2.1,"files_examined":48120,"files_to_hash":12340}`;
    during hashing: `"phase":"hashing"` with `files`, `files_total`, `bytes`,
    `bytes_total`, and, once measurable, `bytes_per_sec` and `eta_sec`; during
    dedupe: `"phase":"dedupe"` with `groups`, `groups_total`, `work_done_bytes`,
    `work_total_bytes`, `reclaimed_bytes`, the current `activity`, and `eta_sec`.
    `work_total_bytes` is the total kernel byte-verify volume the phase will do
    (computed exactly up front) and `work_done_bytes` counts up to it; these
    drive the smooth dedupe progress bar and are emitted raw (never clamped
    backwards), so `work_done_bytes` is non-decreasing and reaches
    `work_total_bytes` on the last dedupe line. The final line is
    `{"event":"done","elapsed_sec":...,"files_scanned":...,"groups_deduped":...,"reclaimed_bytes":...}`.
    Fields that are not yet known (an ETA, a rate) are omitted; a consumer
    reading a line at a time can ignore any line that is not valid JSON.
    Diagnostics share standard error with the stream (an unreadable file, a
    failed ioctl), so such lines do occur.

    Combine with **-q** to silence the human stdout too, e.g.
    `oans -qd --progress=json --hashfile=FILE /srv/data 2>progress.jsonl`.

**\--no-color**
  ~ Disable colored output. Color is also disabled automatically when standard
    output is not a terminal or when the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set.

**\--debug**
  ~ Print debug messages; implies **-v**.

**\--version**
  ~ Print the `oans` version and exit.

**-h**, **\--help**
  ~ Print a short usage summary and exit. (For the full reference, read this
    manual page: **man 8 oans**.)

# OUTPUT

A dedupe run ends with a summary such as:

```
Summary
  Reclaimed      133.1 GiB across 164872 groups
  Elapsed        92.1s
  Already shared 350708 files skipped (no work needed)
```

A scan over a tree containing snapshots also prints:

```
  Same layout    18432 files matched an already-hashed layout (1.4 TiB not read)
```

Those files were not read. Their content was proved identical to a file already
hashed in the same run — every extent at the same physical address, over the
same file size — so their hashes were taken over rather than recomputed. The
digests are exactly what reading them would have produced; a layout that differs
in any way, including the same storage described with different extent
boundaries, is simply hashed normally.

**Reclaimed** is the disk space actually freed: for a group of *N* identical
copies, `oans` keeps one physical copy and frees the other *N*−1, so this is the
honest bytes-freed figure, not an inflated count. Only data that was still
duplicated counts towards it — a copy already sharing part of the target's
storage contributes just the remainder, so a run over an already-deduplicated
tree reports `0 B` rather than the volume it re-examined. **Already shared**
counts files skipped entirely because their storage was already shared. If some
destinations could not be deduped (their data changed since the scan, or the
kernel refused), a **Not deduped** line reports the counts; re-run with **-v**
for detail.

When standard output is not a terminal, or under **-q**, `oans` also prints a
stable machine-readable line:

```
Comparison of extent info shows a net change in shared extents of: N
```

This *N* is a lower-level fiemap diagnostic — the change in bytes the filesystem
reports as shared — and counts the surviving copy as shared too, so for pairs it
is about twice **Reclaimed**. Scripts that parsed this line from upstream
duperemove continue to work.

## File names in output

A file name is untrusted input: anyone who can create a file inside a scanned
tree chooses bytes that `oans` then writes to your terminal. So wherever a path
is printed — reports, the **-L** listing, **\--stats**, error messages and the
live progress display — control characters in it are escaped: tab, newline and
carriage return as `\t`, `\n`, `\r`, every other C0 control, DEL and the C1
controls as `\xNN`. Valid UTF-8 is untouched, so ordinary names print exactly as
they are. Escaping is unconditional, whether or not output is a terminal.

The escape is meant to be read, not parsed back into a path: a name containing a
literal backslash is passed through unchanged. **\--json** escapes the same
characters as `\u00NN`, per JSON.

On a **compressed** btrfs, **Reclaimed** is a *logical* figure: dedupe shares
logical extents but frees compressed blocks, so the real on-disk saving is
smaller, roughly by your compression ratio. For ground truth compare `compsize`
**Disk Usage** before and after a run (its **Referenced** total should not
change — proof that no data was lost).

# EXAMPLES

Dedupe a small directory tree in place (no hashfile; fine for a few files):

```
oans -dr /foo
```

Dedupe a large tree, storing hashes so future runs are incremental. Re-running
the same command only re-hashes and re-dedupes what changed:

```
oans -dr --hashfile=foo.hash foo/
```

Replay the last run — with no *file* arguments `oans` reuses the options, paths,
and excludes saved in the hashfile. Ideal for cron:

```
oans --hashfile=foo.hash
```

Add another directory to the set (this also becomes the new stored config):

```
oans -dr --hashfile=foo.hash foo/ bar/
```

Preview what a run would dedupe, without changing anything (omit **-d**):

```
oans -r foo/
```

Skip tiny files, and every snapshot or NAS metadata directory anywhere in the
tree (the bare names match at any depth):

```
oans -dr --hashfile=media.hash --min-filesize=1M \
     --exclude '.snapshots' --exclude '@eaDir' /srv/media
```

Inspect a hashfile, watch savings over time, and export metrics:

```
oans --stats   --hashfile=foo.hash
oans --history --hashfile=foo.hash
oans --json    --hashfile=foo.hash | jq .reclaimed_total_bytes
```

## Scheduled deduplication

Because the hashfile is self-describing, a scheduled run only needs to name it.
`oans` ships systemd template units (`oans@.service` / `oans@.timer`, installed
by `make install-systemd`). Set a job up once, then enable its timer — the
instance name is the hashfile's basename under `/var/cache/oans`:

```
sudo oans -dr --hashfile=/var/cache/oans/media.hash /srv/media
sudo systemctl enable --now oans@media.timer
```

The timer then re-deduplicates `/srv/media` weekly, hashing only what changed.

# EXIT STATUS

**0**
  ~ Success.

**1**
  ~ A fatal error: invalid options, a hashfile that could not be opened, a
    replay in which *none* of the stored paths still exist (`oans` refuses that
    rather than let the prune empty the hashfile), or a write to the hashfile
    that failed during the scan and took the files hashed in the last few
    seconds with it. The next run hashes those files again.

**2**
  ~ The run completed, but covered **less than it was asked to**: a path named
    on the command line could not be resolved or stat'ed, lies on another
    filesystem than the first one (one run scans one filesystem), or a
    replayed configuration had lost one of its stored roots. Everything else was still
    scanned and deduplicated. Typical causes are a typo, an unmounted path, a
    renamed share, or a shell glob that was quoted by accident.

    This is the status an unattended job should alarm on — the run looks
    healthy otherwise, and would previously have exited **0**. See *EXAMPLES*
    for an `OnFailure=` setup.

**130**, **143**
  ~ Interrupted by **SIGINT** (Ctrl-C) or **SIGTERM**, also when the run had
    lost a root and would otherwise exit **2**. Work already done was
    committed to the hashfile; re-run to continue where it stopped.

Skips the user asked for do **not** affect the exit status: **\--exclude**
matches, files under **\--min-filesize**, non-regular files, and read-only
subvolumes are all reported but are not failures. Neither are files met during
the walk that could not be read — a large tree routinely holds a few — nor
individual per-file dedupe failures (e.g. a file that changed between scan and
dedupe). Those are counted in the *Skipped* and *Not deduped* summary lines and
exported by **\--json**; use those, or **-v**, to detect them.

# ENVIRONMENT

**NO_COLOR**
  ~ If set (to any value), disables colored output, as **\--no-color** does.

# FILES

*hashfile*
  ~ The SQLite database named by **\--hashfile**. Alongside it, SQLite may keep
    `hashfile-wal` and `hashfile-shm` write-ahead-log sidecars; these are normal
    and should not be deleted by hand.

*/var/cache/oans/*
  ~ Conventional location for scheduled-job hashfiles used by the systemd units
    (see *Scheduled deduplication*).

# NOTES

Deduplication is supported only on **btrfs** and **xfs**.

On **xfs**, `oans` identifies the filesystem by its UUID. This works unprivileged
on Linux 6.4 and newer; on older kernels the UUID lookup needs root, so run
`oans` with **sudo** there (a scheduled root job is unaffected). If the
filesystem cannot be identified, `oans` now stops with an error instead of
silently reporting nothing to do. **btrfs** is unaffected.

The read-only report modes (**\--stats**, **\--history**, **\--json**, **-L**)
open the hashfile read-only and are safe to run while another `oans` process is
scanning or deduping the same hashfile: they show a consistent snapshot and
never write. Running two *writing* invocations at once (two **-d** runs, or a
**-d** and an **-R**) against the same hashfile is **not** supported and may
corrupt it.

Interrupting a run with Ctrl-C is safe: the kernel owns the data, and the
hashfile is a transactional database, so you can stop and re-run without
corrupting either. Only a power loss can, in principle, damage a hashfile — and
never your data.

Re-running after an interruption resumes rather than starting over, so a scan
too long to finish in one sitting still converges if you keep running it. Two
things carry over: files that were fully hashed keep their hashes and are
skipped next time, and a very large file that was in the middle of being
hashed — a disk image, a backup archive — is checkpointed as it goes, so the
next run picks it up where the last one stopped instead of reading it again
from the start. Checkpoints need a **\--hashfile** to live in, and are dropped
automatically once the file is fully hashed.

A file left partly hashed is picked up at the very start of the next run,
before the directory walk begins, rather than when the walk happens to reach
it — on a large tree that can be minutes later, and a nearly-finished large
file is the one most worth completing. Only files under the roots named on that
command line are resumed this way, so a hashfile shared between several trees
never causes one run to hash another tree's files.

What does not carry over is anything not yet written to the hashfile. To keep a
scan of millions of files from committing once per file, results are batched and
written every ten seconds, and additionally at each checkpoint; a run killed
outright before its first commit contributes nothing.

**Ctrl-C and `systemctl stop` are handled**, so they do not lose that batch.
On **SIGINT** or **SIGTERM**, `oans` stops taking new work, lets what is in
flight finish, writes a checkpoint for any large file it was in the middle of,
commits the batch, and exits **130** or **143** (128 plus the signal, as a shell
reports for any signalled program). A second signal is not trapped and kills at
once. `SIGKILL` still discards the batch, as it must. An interrupted run is
deliberately **not** added to **\--history**: it covered whatever part of the
tree it reached, and recording it would make a partial scan read as a complete
one.

A checkpoint is only used if the file's size and modification time are still
what they were, which is the same test `oans` applies to every file in a
hashfile to decide it need not be read again. A file whose contents change
while size and mtime are both held fixed — restoring the timestamp after an
in-place write, say — is therefore not noticed, exactly as it would not be for
a fully scanned file. The consequence is a stale or mismatched digest, so a
duplicate may be missed or a group needlessly compared; it is never a risk to
data, because the kernel byte-verifies every deduplication and refuses any pair
that does not match.

Two logically identical files are not always deduped: `oans` works on extent
boundaries, so files with the same content but a different on-disk extent layout
may not match unless block-level matching is enabled with
**\--dedupe-options=partial**.

Files nested arbitrarily deep are supported: `oans` hashes and dedupes files
whose absolute path exceeds the kernel's `PATH_MAX` (4096 bytes), reaching them
by walking down from a reachable ancestor. The one limit is the **root you name
on the command line** (or feed to **\--file-list**): its own absolute path must
fit in `PATH_MAX`, since `oans` canonicalises it up front. A root over the limit
is skipped with an explicit message — scan a shorter ancestor instead, or
bind-mount the directory somewhere shorter. Everything *below* a reachable root
may be any depth.

`oans` is offline, batch deduplication: you point it at specific trees and run it
on demand or on a timer. This differs from `bees`, an always-on daemon that
deduplicates the whole filesystem continuously, and from inline filesystem
dedupe such as ZFS, which maintains a permanent in-RAM dedupe table. `oans` keeps
no such table and imposes no background cost between runs.
