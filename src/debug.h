 * All four print around the live progress block; see progress_printf() in

 *
 * Two of these names are also libc's. `dprintf(3)` is POSIX and `vprintf(3)`
 * is C89, and glibc turns both into macros in bits/stdio2.h *when
 * _FORTIFY_SOURCE is on* - which needs optimization, so a -O0 build never sees
 * them. clang then reports -Wmacro-redefined and -Werror stops the build; gcc
 * does not. That combination went unbuilt for as long as WERROR=1 was
 * silently dropping -O2 (see scripts/lint-build-flags.py), which is why this
 * only surfaced now.
 *
 * Undefining first is safe here rather than merely quiet: every `dprintf(` in
 * the tree is this macro - format string first - and nothing calls POSIX
 * dprintf(fd, ...) or C vprintf(fmt, ap). Shadowing two libc names is still a
 * trap for whoever wants the real ones one day; renaming them is a
 * tree-wide change and belongs in its own commit, not in a build fix.

 * (should always create an error on gcc versions older than 4.4) and then call
 * an undefined function with the error attribute (should always create an
 * error on gcc 4.3 and later).  If for some reason, neither creates a
 * compile-time error, we'll still have a link-time error, which is harder to
