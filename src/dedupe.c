 * Probing a filesystem for FIDEDUPERANGE (#224)

 * oans used to decide what it could deduplicate by matching the statfs magic
 * against btrfs and XFS. That allowlist needs editing and releasing every time
 * another filesystem gains the ioctl, so filesystems it does not name are now
 * asked directly rather than assumed hopeless.
 *
 * The question is a real, block-sized request rather than a zero-length one,
 * and the answer is read from BOTH the ioctl return and the per-destination
 * status. Measured, on a container's overlayfs over ext4:
 *
 *	zero-length	rc=0			(overlayfs answers for itself)
 *	4K request	rc=0, status=-EINVAL	(the lower fs refuses)
 *
 * against plain ext4, where every shape returns rc=-1/EOPNOTSUPP. A stacking
 * filesystem implements remap_file_range as a pass-through, so a zero-length
 * request never reaches the storage underneath and it answers yes for a
 * filesystem that cannot dedupe a single byte. Reading only errno therefore
 * accepts every containerised run on an overlay root, which then hashes the
 * whole tree and fails at dedupe time -- exactly the behaviour refusing
 * unsupported filesystems upfront exists to prevent.
 *
 * The cost of a real request is that on a filesystem that *does* support
 * dedupe, the two ranges may turn out identical and get shared. That is a
 * genuine dedupe of one block within one file, byte-verified by the kernel
 * like any other: it cannot change the file's contents, size or mtime, and it
 * only ever happens when the answer is yes -- that is, when oans is about to
 * deduplicate this tree anyway. test_fs_probe.py pins the file being left
