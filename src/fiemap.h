 * difference it cannot prove away, or any extent without a real physical
 * location - so a caller only ever skips a genuine no-op, never a real dedupe.

 * Two files whose fiemaps describe the same records - same logical offset,
 * same physical address, same length, same flags, for every record, over the
 * same file size - are backed by exactly the same stored bytes, so one's
 * content digest describes the other. This condenses that record array into a
 * DIGEST_LEN key, so a scan can recognise "I have already hashed these very
 * extents" without keeping the array around.
 *
 * The direction of the error matters: a miss costs one redundant hash, a false
 * hit stores a digest of bytes the file never had. So this refuses rather than
 * guesses -
 *
 *   - no extents at all (a hole-only file has no layout to speak of),
 *   - any record the kernel says it cannot pin down: UNKNOWN, DELALLOC (still
 *     in page cache, no stable address), DATA_INLINE (lives in the metadata, so
 *     `fe_physical` names nothing), DATA_ENCRYPTED (equal ciphertext
 *     addresses need not mean equal plaintext), or ENCODED.
 *
 * ENCODED because on a compressed extent `fe_physical` names the extent as a
 * whole, not the offset a file references (#287). Measured on btrfs, kernel
 * 7.1: two files built by cloning the first and the second half of the same
 * compressed extents report identical records, hold different bytes, and the
 * second was stored with the first's digest. The offset is only visible to
 * root (BTRFS_IOC_TREE_SEARCH), so a compressed layout is a miss.
 *
 * SHARED and LAST are masked out of the key: the first is a refcount property
 * that changes when an unrelated file is deduped, the second is positional.
 * Neither says anything about content.
 *
 * The key is a hash, so it cannot be the whole test. The caller must still
 * compare the records themselves before trusting a hit.
 *
 * Returns false (and leaves `key` untouched) when no key can be formed.
