 * bucket 0 is everything <1 MiB, then one bucket per power of two above that
 * (1 MiB, 2 MiB, 4 MiB, …). Each bucket is an intrusive FIFO (walk order
 * preserved within a class) and a 64-bit occupancy bitmask names the non-empty
 * buckets, so both push and pop are O(1): pop finds the top bucket with a single
 * count-leading-zeros on the mask, never a scan over buckets. A huge file sits
 * alone in a high bucket and is therefore dispatched first; the only slack vs
 * exact LPT is the <2× size spread within one bucket, which does not matter for
 * the idle-tail we are avoiding. On a tree of only small files everything lands

 * Every hashfile write is serialized behind the write lock (dbfile_lock()):

 * writer. Committing one transaction per file therefore dominates the scan of
 * a large tree - each commit forces its own WAL frames and fcntl locking,
 * funnelled through that single writer, and extra io-threads just pile up on
 * the lock.
 *
 * So the scan routes every write (the file-record upsert while listing and the
 * hash store while csumming) through one dedicated connection and keeps a
 * single transaction open across many files, committing once every
 * WRITE_BATCH_FILES. Reads keep using their own connections, so read
 * concurrency is unchanged.
 *
 * scan_write_{begin,end,abort}() must be called with the write lock held.
 * scan_writer_{open,close}() bracket the scan while no worker is running.
 *
 * Each begin..end/abort pair is one *unit* - one file's row, one flush of its
 * block hashes, one checkpoint - and runs inside a SAVEPOINT (#274). A failed
 * unit rolls back only itself: the transaction holds every file written in the
 * last ~10 s, and the ids of those rows are already queued for hashing, so
 * rolling the whole batch back used to leave workers writing hashes against
 * ids that were gone, or that the next insert reused for another file. The
 * write lock is held for the whole unit, so units never interleave and the
 * savepoint stack is at most one deep.
 *
 * Sometimes the batch is lost anyway: a failed COMMIT, or an error such as
 * SQLITE_FULL or SQLITE_IOERR, after which SQLite may roll back the whole
 * transaction by itself. The queued ids are then stale and nothing can make
 * them right, so the scan stops (batch_lost()) and the run fails.
