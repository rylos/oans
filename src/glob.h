/*
 * glob.h
 *
 * gitignore-style path matching for --exclude.
 *
 * The syntax is the one git, ripgrep and fd use, because that is what users
 * reach for. The rules, in full:
 *
 *   - A pattern with no '/' matches the **basename** at any depth, so
 *     `@eaDir`, `node_modules` and `*.iso` do the obvious thing. (The old
 *     fnmatch-against-the-full-path behaviour made these match nothing.)
 *   - A pattern starting with '/' is an absolute path, anchored at the
 *     filesystem root, e.g. `/srv/media/cache*`.
 *   - A pattern with a '/' anywhere else matches at any depth, i.e. it is
 *     implicitly prefixed with `**` + '/': `Steam/temp` matches
 *     `/data/Steam/temp` and `/home/u/Steam/temp`. (gitignore anchors these to
 *     the ignore file's directory; there is no ignore file here, so any-depth
 *     is the closest useful analogue - write a leading '/' to anchor.)
 *   - A trailing '/' restricts the pattern to directories.
 *   - `*` matches any run of characters except '/', `?` matches one non-'/'
 *     character, `[abc]` / `[a-z]` / `[!a-z]` are character classes, and `**`
 *     crosses directory boundaries. A backslash makes the next character
 *     literal, inside a class too.
 *
 * Excluding a directory prunes the walk there, so a pattern naming a directory
 * also drops everything under it; you need not add a wildcard for its
 * contents.
 *
 * Negation (`!`) is deliberately not supported.
