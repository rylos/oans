 * This implements a multi progressbar
 * To do this, it reserves n + 3 lines from the bottom
 * of the screen and save the position
 * Those lines will be used in the following way:
 * one line per thread (up to n lines), and then 3 lines for the
 * totals:
 * ### thread 1 progress
 * ### thread 2 progress
 * ###
 * ### thread n progress
 * ### 	Total bytes
 * ### 	Total files
 * ### 	Listing status
 *
 * n is derived from the maximum number of threads, not from the actual
 * number of thread. In such cases, empty lines will follow the "totals"
 * block.
 *
 * Every time the progress thread tries to print the progress, it:
 * - jump back to the saved position
 * - print one line for each running thread, cleaning the existing line
 * - print the totals (again, cleaning the existing line)
 *
 * A function pscan_printf() is provided to print data while the progress
 * thread is running
 * It will grab the lock and print the data before the "progress" area:
 * - jump back to the saved position
 * - print the data
 * - reserves n + 3 lines
 * - save the new position so that the data is not overwritten
 *
 * If stdout is not a tty, no asci code are printed, so this acts as
 * an append-only progressbar.
