"""Hashing one huge file survives being interrupted (#159).

A 1 TiB file six hours into hashing used to start again from byte zero every
time the run was killed, so on a big enough file a scheduled scan could never
finish. Now a run leaves checkpoints behind and the next one picks up from the
last of them.

The property that matters is not that resuming is fast - it is that resuming is
*invisible*: a file hashed across any number of interruptions must end up with
exactly the digest, extent hashes and block hashes it would have had from one
straight-through scan. Nothing downstream could tell a wrong digest from a file
that simply has no duplicate, so a resume that quietly computed something else
would corrupt the hashfile in silence.

DUPEREMOVE_CHECKPOINT_BYTES lowers the one-gigabyte interval so this is
reachable with small files; DUPEREMOVE_CHECKPOINT_STOP abandons a file after
that many checkpoints, standing in for the kill deterministically rather than
racing a signal against a read.
