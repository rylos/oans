"""The live progress block must not strand rows in the scrollback (#179).

The block owns the bottom of the screen and is redrawn in place by moving the
cursor up ``drawn_lines`` rows, so everything else has to be printed through
``progress_printf()``, which erases the block first. A plain ``printf`` moves
the cursor down without ``drawn_lines`` following, and the next redraw homes
*into* the block: the rows above the landing point are stranded on screen and
the message that caused it is erased.

Only reproducible on a tty, which is why the rest of the suite (pipes) cannot
see it. This runs oans under a real pty and replays the byte stream through a
small ANSI emulator to get the screen a user would actually see.
