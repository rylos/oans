"""SIGINT/SIGTERM must commit the open write batch, not throw it away (#201).

Scan durability rides on the batched writer, which commits every
COMMIT_INTERVAL_SEC (10 s). Before this, a signal killed the process outright:
a run interrupted more often than that persisted *nothing*, over and over, and
`systemctl stop oans@...` - the scheduled NAS case - is exactly such a signal.

Racing a real `sleep N; kill` against a scan is not a test: to make the signal
reliably land mid-run the tree has to be big enough that even fast storage
cannot finish it, which means writing gigabytes in setUp and still coin-flipping
on a faster box. So the deterministic cases use DUPEREMOVE_INTERRUPT_AFTER,
which raises the *real* signal after a named number of files - same handler,
same unwinding, same exit status - exactly as DUPEREMOVE_CHECKPOINT_STOP stands
in for the kill in test_hash_resume.py. One test does send a real signal, to
keep the end-to-end path honest.
