"""Pointing oans at a non-btrfs/XFS filesystem must fail loudly, not exit 0.

Regression guard: an unsupported seed root used to be accepted, walked, and
then fail every FIEMAP with per-file errors while still exiting 0 ("Nothing to
deduplicate"). It is now refused with a clear message and a non-zero exit,
before anything is hashed.

Since #224 the refusal comes from probing the filesystem for FIDEDUPERANGE
rather than from matching its name against btrfs and XFS, so the message names
the missing ioctl. What must not change is the outcome: loud, non-zero, and no
per-file FIEMAP spam.
