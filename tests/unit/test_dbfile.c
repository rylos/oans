 * carry the same digest *and* sit contiguously in both files. It was 237 of
 * 247 mutants surviving - 4% killed - and the whole of it is reachable from
 * here, because compare_extents() and record_match() are static in a file
 * tests.c #includes, so they can be called directly rather than through the
 * thread pool and the database that normally drive them.
 *
 * A run found too long is a dedupe request the kernel byte-verify rejects;
 * one found too short is a duplicate nobody ever finds. Neither says anything

 * What every `perror_sqlite` + `goto out` pair is for.
 *
 * dbfile.c has 82 of them and until now no unit test reached one: they guard a
 * bind or a step failing, which a healthy in-memory database never does. The
 * residue was triaged as needing a fault-injection seam - and the seam is
 * sqlite's own `query_only`, which needs no change to the product.
 *
 * The invariant is the one that matters for a cache nothing downstream
 * validates. A hashfile is not checked by anything that reads it, so a write
 * that failed and *said so* costs one re-hash, while a write that failed and
 * returned success produces a run that exits 0, looks correct, and has a hole
 * in it. Every one of these asserts the first and would fail on the second.
